# Engineering Lab

This is a personal lab for experiments in software engineering.

## Scope
- Code quality (lint, type check, tests)
- CI/CD workflows
- Security and reliability
- Data and system experiments
- Any other topics worth exploring

## Structure
- `src/` — code samples
- `tests/` — test files
- `.github/workflows/` — automation
- `.secrets/` — fake data for security checks
- More folders will be added for new topics

## Notes
- Each commit documents one experiment
- Some code is intentionally broken to test tooling
- Expect both working and failing examples
